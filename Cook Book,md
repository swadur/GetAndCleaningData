The dataset produced is from a database that came from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time') were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (timeBodyAccelerationeleration-XYZ and timeGravityAcceleration-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (timeBodyAccelerationelerationJerk-XYZ and timeBodyGyroscopescopeJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (timeBodyAccelerationelerationMagnitude, timeGravityAccelerationMagnitude, timeBodyAccelerationelerationJerkMag, timeBodyGyroscopescopeMagnitude, timeBodyGyroscopescopeJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing frequencyBodyAcceleration-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerk-XYZ, frequencyBodyGyroscope-XYZ, frequencyBodyAccelerationJerkMag, frequencyBodyGyroscopescopeMagnitude, frequencyBodyGyroscopescopeJerkMag.

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
